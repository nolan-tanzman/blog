> I want to start by saying how sorry I am for how things ended between us. I know it wasn't easy for either of us, but I want you to know that I have taken the time to reflect on our relationship and have worked to become a better person. I haven't lost sight of the dream of us becoming a family again one day and I'm determined to make that dream a reality.

I have worked on myself since then and although I understand that it cannot make up for what happened, I want you to know that I still hold on to the hope that someday we can become a family again. I love you and I'm sorry.

> I deeply regret how our relationship ended and I want to acknowledge that it wasn't what either of us desired. Since that time, I've devoted myself to personal growth and self-improvement. While I understand that it can never fully compensate for what occurred, I want you to know that I still carry hope in my heart for a future where we can reunite as a family. I love you, and I'm truly sorry.
